- Formulated and launched an event-driven microservice architecture using AWS EventBridge, intercepting and routing events seamlessly from downstream systems to target SQS queues.<br/><br/>

- The strategic architectural enhancement led to a 25% reduction in API calls, boosting system efficiency by 30%.<br/><br/>

- Incorporated CloudWatch metrics for real-time monitoring of the health and performance of various SQS instances, guaranteeing proactive notifications and rapid responses to critical system events.
