- Architected and deployed end-to-end microservice using Spring, facilitating synchronous and asynchronous
  integrations with diverse logistic, omni-channel, and partner systems; increasing system efficiency by 50%.<br/><br/>

- Optimized system scalability by incorporating a Load Balancer employing Round Robin logic, boosting
  system availability, enhancing throughput, and minimizing downtime. Seamlessly integrated CI/CD pipelines
  for automated microservice deployment across multiple server environments.<br/><br/>

- Enriched system performance using Time-Aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) cache and employing aspect,
  event and annotation-driven architectures. Leveraged ThreadPool executors for concurrent IO operations.<br/><br/>

- Enhanced system reliability by managing SQL and NoSQL databases in primary-replica configurations. Successfully integrated major marketplaces and logistic partners, including Amazon Marketplace (SmartConnect & Seller Party models), CloudTail (Vendor APIs), and Amazon Shipping Provider (Shipping APIs).

<!-- interceptor, and AOP techniques to monitor service execution time, optimize database queries, and reduce
memory usage. Implemented an event driven architecture for real-time data processing with Apache
Kafka, providing high resiliency and fault tolerance capabilities.<br/><br/>
- Designed and implemented the front-end UI using AngularJS, ensuring seamless user experience while
providing features such as dynamic dashboard generation based on business requirements, customizable charts,
and interactive graphs. Utilized RESTful APIs for communication between client and server side,
promoting loose coupling and high cohesion in application design.<br/><br/>
- Built a monitoring solution using Prometheus and Grafana, allowing developers to easily visualize
performance metrics and track changes over time. Additionally, configured ELK stack for centralized log
management and analysis, improving operational efficiency and reducing troubleshooting time.<br/><br/>
- Successfully managed container orchestration using Docker Swarm, promoting consistent environment
deployments across different development, testing, staging, and production environments.
Improved security measures by implementing SSL encryption, JWT token authentication, and role-based access
control mechanisms.<br/><br/>
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams like DevOps, Data Science, and Business Intelligence to
ensure successful integration of new functionalities into existing systems, thereby driving product
development and maintaining quality assurance standards. -->

<!-- This project involved creating a highly scalable, performant, secure, and efficient microservices-based
solution that met all the specified requirements. It was crucial to ensure that each component worked
seamlessly together, resulting in a robust, reliable, and adaptive platform capable of handling large
data volumes efficiently. The final implementation exceeded expectations, demonstrating exceptional
capabilities in terms of performance, reliability, and ease of use.
The success of this project not only showcased my technical proficiencies but also allowed me to
contribute to the growth and evolution of a cutting-edge technology company. I am confident that
my skills and expertise will continue to serve this organization well in future projects."

<!-- - Pioneered the design, development and maintenance of an end-to-end architecture for a microservice in Spring Boot to support synchronous and asynchronous integrations with different logistic, omni-channel and external partner systems, thereby increasing the efficiency of integrations by 50%.<br/><br/>

- Implemented horizontal scaling by introducing a Load Balancer with Round Robin logic to route the incoming requests to different proxy instances to increase the availability of the system, lower the downtime and increase the throughput.<br/><br/>

- Integrated Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) cache, aspect-driven and annotation-driven programming, ThreadPool executors to support multiple IO oprations, Log4j2.<br/><br/>

- Maintained SQL and NoSQL databases in the master-slave mode to increase the reliability of the system.<br/><br/>

- Onboarded marketplaces like Amazon Marketplace (SmartConnect and Seller Party models), CloudTail (Vendor APIs), Myntra (PPMP), and logistic patners like Amazon Shipping Provider (Shipping APIs). -->
