- Pioneered the design, development and maintenance of an end-to-end architecture for a microservice in Spring Boot to support synchronous and asynchronous integrations with different logistic, omni-channel and external partner systems, thereby increasing the efficiency of integrations by 50%.<br/><br/>

- Implemented horizontal scaling by introducing a Load Balancer with Round Robin logic to route the incoming requests to different proxy instances to increase the availability of the system, lower the downtime and increase the throughput.<br/><br/>

- Integrated Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU) cache, aspect-driven and annotation-driven programming, ThreadPool executors to support multiple IO oprations, Log4j2.<br/><br/>

- Maintained SQL and NoSQL databases in the master-slave mode to increase the reliability of the system.<br/><br/>

- Onboarded marketplaces like Amazon Marketplace (SmartConnect and Seller Party models), CloudTail (Vendor APIs), Myntra (PPMP), and logistic patners like Amazon Shipping Provider (Shipping APIs).
