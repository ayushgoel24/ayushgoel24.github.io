- Operationalized MLOps pipeline for revenue forecasting, utilizing Apache Airflow for workflow management and implementing a state-of-the-art ensemble model (XGBoost and LSTM) on comprehensive historical data from various e-commerce platforms, which led to a remarkable 30% revenue surge.<br/><br/>

- Ensured sustained model accuracy by instituting a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) framework using Jenkins, implementing seamless adaptation to new data through MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning, and incorporating Grafana for real-time monitoring and proactive issue resolution.
