- Added Filebeat on the Integration proxy layer for forwarding log data to a centralised Logstash server, which processed the data from various sources and passed them to ElasticSearch instances.<br/><br/>

- Set-up Kibana to visualize the ElasticSearch data for each metric and created Visualization charts to monitor the different metrics.
