- Developed a Semi-Autonomous mobile robot from scratch capable of being operated remotely or autonomously in a pre-defined path.<br><br>

- Incorporated the capabilities of live video surveillance and face recognition to enhance security.<br><br>

- The robot is cheap and flexible, and has implementations in several domains: surveillance, industries, research.

<!-- Collaborated with the [Developer Team](https://caimconsulting.in/developers/?) to develop the front-end and deploy the website on Heroku for a pro-bono legal startup [Caim Consulting](https://caimconsulting.in/). -->
