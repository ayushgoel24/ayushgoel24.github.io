<!-- Face Mask Detection system to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams. Own custom dataset was built using Bing Search API and Kaggle.

Inspired by Adrian Rosebrock's [PyImageSearch Blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/). -->
