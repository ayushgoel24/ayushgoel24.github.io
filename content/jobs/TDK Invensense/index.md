- Integrated **ROS2** **Nav2**-based point-to-point navigation pipeline for mobile robots, fusing **LiDAR**, **Depth Camera** and **IMU** readings to build accurate maps with **SLAM toolbox** to implement **Lifelong Mapping**. Enhanced adaptability through **Behavior Trees**, increasing the task efficiency in varied environments.

- Developed end-to-end object detection pipeline using **NVIDIA Issac** by fusing **Depth camera** images and **3D point cloud** data, achieving a **60% mAP**, with reduced false positives and improved robotic response time.

- Architected **AWS pipeline** using IoT, Lambda, Elastic Search, wrote **ROS2 C++** drivers; achieving **50%** faster data processing time, **30%** less operational costs, better reliability, and live dashboard capabilities.
