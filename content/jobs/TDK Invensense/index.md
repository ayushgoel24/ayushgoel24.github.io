- Architected an **AWS**-based pipeline integrating IoT, Lambda, and Elastic Search for robot telemetry. This advanced design led to a **50%** acceleration in data processing, **30%** operational cost savings, and enhanced reliability, supplemented with real-time dashboard functionalities. Concurrently, authored **ROS2 C++** drivers to further refine robot data interfacing.

- Pioneered an **ROS2 Nav2** point-to-point navigation system for autonomous mobile robots. Seamlessly fused **LiDAR**, **Depth Camera**, and **IMU** inputs for precise SLAM toolbox-based mapping, enabling **Lifelong Mapping**. Further augmented navigation capabilities leveraging **Behavior Trees**, elevating task efficiency across diverse scenarios.

- Engineered a state-of-the-art **object detection** framework using **NVIDIA Isaac**. Integrated **Depth Camera** imagery and **3D point cloud** datasets to achieve a **60% mean Average Precision** (mAP). This holistic approach curtailed false positives and significantly bolstered robotic response times.

- Championed a **documentation-driven** approach, creating comprehensive technical documentation, developer guides, and API references, streamlining onboarding for new team members and facilitating knowledge transfer.

- Established **continuous integration** (CI) and **continuous deployment** (CD) practices tailored for robotics software, automating testing, and ensuring consistent code quality while accelerating the development cycle.

<!-- - Integrated **ROS2** **Nav2**-based point-to-point navigation pipeline for mobile robots, fusing **LiDAR**, **Depth Camera** and **IMU** readings to build accurate maps with **SLAM toolbox** to implement **Lifelong Mapping**. Enhanced adaptability through **Behavior Trees**, increasing the task efficiency in varied environments.

- Developed end-to-end object detection pipeline using **NVIDIA Issac** by fusing **Depth camera** images and **3D point cloud** data, achieving a **60% mAP**, with reduced false positives and improved robotic response time.

- Architected **AWS pipeline** using IoT, Lambda, Elastic Search, wrote **ROS2 C++** drivers; achieving **50%** faster data processing time, **30%** less operational costs, better reliability, and live dashboard capabilities. -->
