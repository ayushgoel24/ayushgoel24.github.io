Hello!

I am <b>Ayush Goel</b>, a graduate student in <b>Robotics</b> at the <b>University of Pennsylvania</b>.

I have previously worked as a <b>Senior Software Development Engineer</b> for 4 years, during which I have led several critical projects. I have also mentored and managed a team of Software Engineers, and was in regular discussions with Engineering and Business leaders for product and engineering roadmap.

I am passionate about developing and contributing to <b>open-source softwares</b> and <b>robotics</b>, and my primary interest lies in field of <b>Perception</b>, <b>Robot Learning</b>, <b>Autonomous Robots</b> and <b>Software Development</b>. As a student at the University of Pennsylvania, I have honed my skills in the field through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects. I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to real-world applications through an internship opportunity. I am a diligent worker who is committed to working wisely and persistently to achieve my objectives.

<!-- I intend to focus my robotics career on the entrepreneurship/innovation track while participating in the software engineering team. -->

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for connecting with like-minded individuals in the field. Outside of my studies, I enjoy participating in sports and traveling to expand my perspective and gain new experiences. I am always open to building connections with others who share similar interests and believe that through collaboration we can achieve mutual growth and success.

If our goals and passions align, I welcome the opportunity to connect and collaborate with you!

<!-- As a CS Professional and a ROBO grad student, my primary interest lies in field of Autonomous Robots, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Software Development. I designed and developed a semi-autonomous mobile robot from scratch during my undergrad, wherein I worked on the mechanical, electrical and computational aspects of a mobile robot. I hope to develop more robust solutions for mobile robots enabling them to accomplish a variety of tasks. Whether for work or pleasure, I enjoy exploring ideas that leverage technology to enhance people's lives. -->
