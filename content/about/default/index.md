Hello!

I am Ayush Goel, a graduate student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania.

I completed my undergrad in Mechatronics Engineering and then worked as a Senior Software Development Engineer for 4 years.

As a CS Professional and a ROBO grad student, my primary interest lies in field of Autonomous Robots, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Software Development. I designed and developed a semi-autonomous mobile robot from scratch during my undergrad, wherein I worked on the mechanical, electrical and computational aspects of a mobile robot. I hope to develop more robust solutions for mobile robots enabling them to accomplish a variety of tasks. Whether for work or pleasure, I enjoy exploring ideas that leverage technology to enhance people's lives.
