Greetings! I'm Ayush Goel, a dedicated Robotics and Software Engineer currently deepening my expertise at the University of Pennsylvania with a Master's in Robotics. My academic endeavors have endowed me with profound insights into Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Advanced Robotics. This knowledge is further enriched by my experience as a Teaching Assistant for courses like Data Structures, Algorithms and Software Design, and Operating Systems.

Before this academic pursuit, I dedicated 4 years as a Senior Software Engineer, leading critical projects and mentoring a vibrant team of Software Engineers. My collaboration with Engineering and Business leaders played a crucial role in shaping the product and engineering roadmap.

Professionally, I've had the privilege of working across diverse geographies and sectors. My role at TDK InvenSense in San Jose, California, saw me integrating state-of-the-art technologies for mobile robots, from integrating ROS2 Nav2-based navigation pipelines to developing object detection pipelines using NVIDIA Issac. My contributions at Unicommerce eSolutions in Gurugram and Capgemini India in Pune further showcase my versatility and leadership in the software domain. As a Senior Software Engineer, I led teams, pioneered microservice architectures, and spearheaded significant transitions for major financial institutions. My stint as a Research Intern at IIT Delhi's Programme in Autonomous Robotics saw me engineer a semi-autonomous mobile robot with advanced features like live video surveillance and face recognition.

My projects, ranging from stereo visual odometry to fusing LiDAR and Radar measurements, stand testament to my passion for robotics and deep learning. I'm proficient in programming languages like C++, Python, and JAVA and have a strong grasp of tools and frameworks such as Git/GitHub, Docker, ROS, OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, to name a few.

Outside the technical realm, I'm an ardent advocate for networking and collaboration. I cherish interactions with peers who resonate with my passion for the field. Beyond work and studies, I'm an avid sports enthusiast and traveler, always seeking new experiences and perspectives.

In a nutshell, I represent a synergy of academic depth and industry acumen. I'm driven by challenges and the zeal to innovate. If my journey resonates with you, I'm eager to connect and explore collaborative opportunities. Together, we can pave the way for mutual growth and success!
