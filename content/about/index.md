Hello!

I did my undergraduation in B.E. Mechatronics Engineering from [Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, India](https://www.thapar.edu/). I started developing robots since I was 14 years old. I have an avid interest in the Robotics domain specifically in the field of Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Development Engineer responsible for several microservices code development and testing in [Unicommerce eSolutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://unicommerce.com/).
